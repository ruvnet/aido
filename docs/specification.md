# AIDO Specification

## Overview

The AI-Driven Decentralized Organization (AIDO) is a groundbreaking system that leverages artificial intelligence to enable autonomous and distributed decision-making without relying on traditional blockchain or cryptocurrency frameworks. Unlike conventional DAOs, AIDO harnesses a network of specialized AI agents to collaboratively manage operations, make strategic decisions, and allocate tasks efficiently.

## Core Components

### 1. AI Agents Network

#### Purpose
The foundation of AIDO is a network of AI agents with different specializations:
- Finance
- Operations
- Strategy
- Human Resources

#### Requirements
- Each agent must have its own decision-making model using ML algorithms
- Agents must communicate and collaborate effectively
- Support for dynamic agent registration and capability updates
- Secure agent authentication and authorization

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface Agent {
    id: string;
    name: string;
    specialty: string;
    capabilities: string[];
    model: {
        type: 'neural_network' | 'decision_tree';
        parameters: Record<string, any>;
    };
    reputation: number;
}
```

### 2. Distributed Decision-Making System

#### Purpose
Enable collective decision-making through:
- Proposal submission
- Evaluation process
- Voting mechanism
- Natural language processing for proposal understanding

#### Requirements
- Any agent can submit proposals
- Evaluation based on predefined criteria
- NLP-powered proposal analysis
- Transparent decision tracking

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface Proposal {
    id: string;
    content: string;
    author: Agent;
    evaluations: Evaluation[];
    status: 'pending' | 'evaluating' | 'accepted' | 'rejected';
    created_at: Date;
}
```

### 3. Consensus Algorithm

#### Purpose
Ensure collective agreement through:
- Reputation-based voting weight
- Conflict resolution
- Decision finalization

#### Requirements
- Weight votes based on agent reputation
- Handle disagreements effectively
- Maintain decision transparency
- Support for different consensus rules

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface ConsensusRule {
    threshold: number;
    minimum_votes: number;
    weight_factors: {
        reputation: number;
        specialty_relevance: number;
    };
}
```

### 4. Task Allocation System

#### Purpose
Optimize work distribution through:
- Capability matching
- Workload balancing
- Performance tracking
- Reinforcement learning

#### Requirements
- Match tasks to agent capabilities
- Consider current workload
- Track task completion metrics
- Learn from allocation outcomes

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface Task {
    id: string;
    description: string;
    required_capabilities: string[];
    priority: number;
    assigned_agent?: Agent;
    status: 'pending' | 'assigned' | 'in_progress' | 'completed';
    metrics: {
        completion_time?: number;
        quality_score?: number;
    };
}
```

### 5. Performance Monitoring

#### Purpose
Track and improve system performance through:
- KPI monitoring
- Pattern analysis
- Continuous learning
- Performance optimization

#### Requirements
- Track key performance indicators
- Analyze decision patterns
- Monitor agent performance
- Generate improvement suggestions

#### Technical Implementation
```typescript
interface PerformanceMetrics {
    proposal_metrics: {
        total_proposals: number;
        acceptance_rate: number;
        average_evaluation_time: number;
    };
    task_metrics: {
        total_tasks: number;
        completion_rate: number;
        average_completion_time: number;
    };
    agent_metrics: Record<string, {
        tasks_completed: number;
        average_task_score: number;
        proposal_success_rate: number;
    }>;
}
```
