# AIDO Implementation Documentation

## Introduction

The AI-Driven Decentralized Organization (AIDO) implementation follows a unique approach combining the London School of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with the SPARC methodology. This combination creates a framework for fully autonomous application development that can iterate and improve itself overnight.

The London style of TDD focuses on building from the outside in, starting with high-level API tests and working downward, ensuring each component behaves correctly in isolation. By using extensive mocking of dependencies, it allows us to verify behavior without needing the full system in place from the start.

## Overview

The SPARC methodology provides a structured roadmap through five phases:
1. **Specification**: Define comprehensive tests and requirements
2. **Pseudocode**: Outline algorithmic approaches
3. **Architecture**: Design component structure and interactions
4. **Refinement**: Implement continuous improvement
5. **Completion**: Finalize implementation and deployment

This approach enables autonomous development where:
- High-level tests guide implementation
- AI analyzes failed tests and generates fixes
- Solutions are verified automatically
- Code is refined continuously
- Systems are built and validated overnight

## Development Workflow

1. Start with high-level API tests defined in the specification
2. Use outside-in TDD to implement components
3. Verify behavior through extensive mocking
4. Enable autonomous overnight development
5. Continuously refine through automated feedback
6. Deploy with comprehensive verification

## Getting Started

1. Review the [Specification](specification.md) to understand system requirements
2. Study the [Test-Driven Development](test-driven-development.md) approach
3. Follow the [Architecture](architecture.md) for system structure
4. Implement following [Pseudocode](pseudocode.md) guidelines
5. Apply [Refinement](refinement.md) strategies
6. Complete using [Completion](completion.md) checklist

This documentation provides a complete roadmap for implementing AIDO using autonomous development practices that ensure high quality and continuous improvement.
